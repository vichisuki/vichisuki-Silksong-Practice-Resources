# Bell Route LP IL Split Files

Created using [HKSplitMaker](https://hksplitmaker.com/). Use this website to easily create more Silksong splits and other existing categories.

To be used with [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit).

Open the split files and install any dependencies (usually just the Silksong Autosplitter) and make sure that **Compare Against** is set to **Game Time, not Real Time.**

Make a copy of the template file on the [ComSoB Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Hy5k_h9dBUUPlwh_I14K-DEwGcNdVQ0utI-KX56d8c/edit?gid=357279231#gid=357279231) and copy your final times for each IL directly into the relevant category.
