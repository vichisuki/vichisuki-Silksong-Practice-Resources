# Vichisuki's Silksong Practice Resources
This repository serves as a way for me to host my own practice resources created for Silksong, at this point in time only containing savestates to be used with [Silksong's Debug Mod](https://github.com/hk-speedrunning/Silksong.DebugMod) and split files for use with [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit).

For a tutorial on how to set up these tools, I recommend checking out Ivy's Silksong Tutorial series, particularly the [introductory guide found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYudtHjQmzQ).

## Savestates
For a more detailed rundown on what each savestate does, view:
- [Bell Route - Latest Patch Savestate Readme](BELLROUTE-SAVESTATES-README.md)

This savestate bundle was designed for Silksong to be more in line with older savestate bundles used for practicing Hollow Knight, particularly in four different categories.

### IL
This is a split used to directly record an IL attempt, intended for use with the accompanying split files found in the repository. They have been designed to be used with the [ComSOB spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Hy5k_h9dBUUPlwh_I14K-DEwGcNdVQ0utI-KX56d8c/edit?gid=7316953#gid=7316953).

### Movement
Typically starts one room after the IL starts, or after any kind of cutscenes that would otherwise be tedious to sit through when trying to practice.

### Bosses
Self explanatory, savestates outside each major boss and sometimes arenas in the route.

### Trick
Savestate for each major "trick" in the run. Note that what is defined as a trick is completely subjective and arbitrary, I just tried to make it so that I could practice each aspect that is difficult to me.

If you notice any errors or would like to add additional savestates, make a pull request or contact me on discord.
